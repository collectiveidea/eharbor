# eHarbor

A teaching app used by [Collective Idea](http://collectiveidea.com) for exploring Ruby on Rails.

## Versions

Branches exist for various Rails versions and (mostly old) alternate test frameworks. 

Use it as a reference. Each version has slight differences, but they're mainly for what's changed between versions of Rails. 

## Why are the commits so old?

When a new version of Rails appears, we do an interactive git rebase to modify the history while keeping the commits the same. It is a bit of magic, but good magic.

## Can I use this?

Sure, and tell us about it! For us, it is a teaching tool but if you find a use for it other than that, let us know!
