= Money Column

Rails plugin that makes handling of money values in the database convenient. On assignment the money column will
parse the input and apply heuristics to normalize oddball user input. 

Extracted from Shopify and has seen years of production use. 

= Example use

  class Product < ActiveRecord::Base
    money_column  :price
  end

  sneakers = Product.new :price => '$199.95'
  sneakers.price #=> #<Money value:199.95>

= Database

All money values need to be declared as decimal columns. Just go for it. It will safe you from a world of trouble. 

  create_table "products" do |t|
    t.string   "title"
    t.decimal  "price", :precision => 10, :scale => 2, :default => 0.0
  end
